# SieveJS
SieveJS is essentially cheat engine but for websites. 

SieveJS can scan all values on a website and filter them based on complex queries. It can observe when values change, modify values, lock values, and identify where the value was changed from. 

This was originally intended for hacking flash games, although it's quite a useful tool in general. Eventually this will become an extension, but for now it's just a few javascript functions.

Everything was tested in chrome. Idk about anything else lol.
